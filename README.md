# CMS Particle Track Reconstruction with DeepCore CNN

In this project, my main objectives were first to understand where the CNN was failing to predict the track parameters and why (certain eta, energy hard?), and second to improve the ROOT visualization of prediction and target for events to inspect events where reconstruction was particularly problematic.

Relevant notebooks from the summer, as well as auxilliary files, but not ROOT files, which presented a difficulty in uploading to GitHub (love CERN EOS), are available in the exercises folders. The plotting notebook is available in the sophomore year folder as the "final" notebook. Slides I presented to the group are also attached.
